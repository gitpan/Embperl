Embperl gives you the power to embed Perl code in your HTML documents 
and the ability to build your Web site out of small reusable objects 
in a OO-style. You can also take advantage all available Perl modules, 
(including DBI for database access) use their functionality and easily 
include their output into your web pages.<p>

including dynamic tables, formfield-processing, escaping/unescaping,

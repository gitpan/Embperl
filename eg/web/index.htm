<p><b>Embperl</b> is a framework for building websites with <b>Perl</b>.</p>

<p>For the beginner it's an easy to setup and use way of embedding Perl code in
HTML pages. 

It delivers several features that ease the task of creating a
websites, including dynamic tables, formfield-processing, escaping/unescaping,
session handling, caching and more.</p>

<p>If your demands grow it gives you the power to make your Website <b>object-oriented</b>
and build it out of small reusable components. If you don't like the idea of
mixing up all your layout and code then Embperl also supports separating it in
different objects (e.g. creating an MVC application). Of course Embperl doesn't
tie you to HTML - it allows components to be from different source formats (e.g.
HTML, WML, XML, POD, ...) and if necessary transforms them (for example via
XSLT) to other output formats. This is achieved by dividing the output
generation into small steps, where each is processed by a plugable provider.
Advanced users can create their own syntax definitions (for example tag
libraries) and extend Embperl by writing their own providers and
much more...</p>

<p>Embperl is a server-side tool, which means that it's browser-independent. It can
run in various ways: under mod_perl, as a CGI script, or offline.</p>

This directory contains the new Embperl website.
It uses most of the new possibilites of Embperl 2.0b6+. To take a look at it 
just type "make start" and then request http://localhost:8531/eg/web/ . 

To get it fully working you need to have libxml installed and a database. 
(see below for database setup).


Here are a few notes on the included files, to make the first orientation
easier:

epwebapp.pl     Application object, which controls the whole execution logic
                (the controller when you think in MVC terms)

config.pl       Configuration, includeing the site structure
messages.pl     Messages in multiple languages (currently german and english)
base.epl        The base template for the site
content.epl     The base template for the content part (right side) of the
                base directory
header.epl      The header
footer.epl      The footer
menuleft.epl    The menu on the left
menulist.epl    Used by some files to display a list from the menu structure
notfound.htm    This page is display when the user enters a unkown URL
index.htm       Home page english
indexD.htm      Home page german
pod.xsl         Standard XSL stylesheet for displaying POD files

pod/*           This dirtory contains the index pages for POD display
                The actual POD files for documentation and introduction
                are taken from the Embperl main directory, to avoid duplication
                of files. How files are mapped to URIs is described in config.pl

db/*            Database related pages, to display and add information
db/epwebapp.pl  This application object overrides the one from the base directory
                and adds functionality for database access.



Database setup
--------------

Parts of the Website are database driven, so you need a
database to use it. To setup a database and populate it
with some initial content, do the following steps:

- install DBI

- install a DBD driver for your database

- install DBIx::Recordset

- create a database called 'embperl'
    for example:
    - for Mysql run 'mysqladmin create embperl'
    - on Windows goto to control panel and ODBC Manager and setup a 
      datasource called "embperl"

- to create the tables run 'perl eg/webutil/setupdb.pl'

If you don't want to name your database embperl or you need set specify a
user name, you can configure this at the top of eg/web/config.pl.
